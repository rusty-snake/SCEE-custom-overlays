## Smoothness

See, review, edit and maintain road `smoothness`.
- `highway`s that are `service=driveway`, `service=slipway`, `access=private` or `access=no` are not selected unless they have an existing `smoothness` tag.
- Dash-filter is used for QA checks on the `surface`.
- Keep in mind that there are other surface tags such as `cycleway:surface` and `footway:surface` that are not evaluated by this overlay.
- Tip: Create a "Smoothness" preset for use with this overlay.
- Smoothness overlay request: streetcomplete/StreetComplete#5486

## Highway

See, review, edit and maintain the `highway` type of ways.
- service type and footway type are colored as well. cycleway type is not colored because the same key is used for tagging cycleways on streets.
- Dash-filter is used to show `oneway`.

- `agricultural=yes` is often a misstagged `motor_vehicle=agricultural`.
- `bicycle=permissive` on public footways is not the legal access.
